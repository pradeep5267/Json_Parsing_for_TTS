0,so thank you very much for coming David it's good to have you here how real is artificial intelligence on that how far in the continuum is IBM Watson in operability artificial intelligence,good as my pleasure Michael glad to be with you the question of how real is artificial intelligence is a complex one I would say %HESITATION if if we define artificial intelligence is the ability of a machine on its own to understand large volumes of data to reason that data with a purpose to it to predict the future and then tell you continue to learn and get better is happening today in certain fields yes so so first of all once once it's actually intelligent it will no longer be artificial so we're moving to the point that these systems increasingly understand enormous volumes of data
